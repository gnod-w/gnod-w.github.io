  title       = {Efficient evolution framework for chirality control in non-{Hermitian} systems with adiabaticity engineering},
  abstract    = {The eigenvalue of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian often forms a self-intersecting Riemann surface, leading to a unique mode conversion phenomenon when the Hamiltonian evolves along certain loop paths around an exceptional point (EP). However, two fundamental problems exist with the conventional scheme of EP encircling: the speed of mode conversion is restricted by the adiabatic requirement, and the chirality cannot be freely controlled. Here, we introduce a method which dynamically engineers the adiabaticity in the evolution of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that allows for both chiral and nonchiral mode conversion on the same path. Our method is based on quantifying and controlling the instantaneous adiabaticity, allowing for nonuniform evolution throughout the entire path. We apply our method into the microwave waveguide system and by optimizing the distributed adiabaticity along the evolution loop, we achieve the same quality of mode conversion as conventional quasiadiabatic evolution in only one-fourth of the time. Our approach provides an on-demand solution to address the speed and chirality challenges associated with EP encircling, which does not depend on specific model. It also facilitates the dynamic manipulation and regulation of nonadiabatic processes, thereby accelerating the operation and allowing for a selection among various mode conversion patterns.},

  title       = {Twisted moiré conductive thermal metasurface},
  abstract    = {Extensive investigations on the moiré magic angle in twisted bilayer graphene have unlocked the emerging field—twistronics. Recently, its optics analogue, namely opto-twistronics, further expands the potential universal applicability of twistronics. However, since heat diffusion neither possesses the dispersion like photons nor carries the band structure as electrons, the real magic angle in electrons or photons is ill-defined for heat diffusion, making it elusive to understand or design any thermal analogue of magic angle. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate the twisted thermotics in a twisted diffusion system by judiciously tailoring thermal coupling, in which twisting an analog thermal magic angle would result in the function switching from cloaking to concentration. Our work provides insights for the tunable heat diffusion control, and opens up an unexpected branch for twistronics -- twisted thermotics, paving the way towards field manipulation in twisted configurations including but not limited to fluids},

  abstract    = {Phase modulation has scarcely been mentioned in diffusive physical systems because the diffusion process does not carry the momentum like waves. Recently, non-Hermitian physics provides a unique perspective for understanding diffusion and shows prospects in thermal phase regulation, exemplified by the discovery of anti-parity-time (APT) symmetry in diffusive systems. However, precise control of thermal phase remains elusive hitherto and can hardly be realized, due to the phase oscillations. Here we construct the PT-symmetric diffusive systems to achieve the complete suppression of thermal phase oscillation. The real coupling of diffusive fields is readily established through a strong convective background, and the decay-rate detuning is enabled by thermal metamaterial design. We observe the phase transition of PT symmetry breaking with the symmetry-determined amplitude and phase regulation of coupled temperature fields. Our work shows the existence of PT symmetry in dissipative energy exchanges and provides unique approaches for harnessing the mass transfer of particles, wave dynamics in strongly scattering systems, and thermal conduction.},

  abstract    = {Thermal InfraRed (TIR) technology has achieved signiﬁcant progress, in light of its ability to reﬂect lighting conditions in dark environments, enhancing its vital role in industrial and consumer electronics. However, current research on TIR image semantic segmentation mainly focuses on urban scenes, while the segmentation of human bodies in the TIR domain remains an under-explored area, which holds considerable promise for applications such as low-light security checks, nocturnal combat scenarios, and human action recognition. In this paper, we introduce a novel computer-vision task—Thermal InfraRed Human Body Parsing, which aims to generate accurate segmentation maps for different parts of human bodies in TIR images. To open up future research in this area, we collect a new dataset called HBTIR, which contains TIR images and corresponding semantic labels of 32 participants in various poses. Furthermore, we propose a novel neural network called HBTIRSeg, which incorporates an edge-guided attention mechanism speciﬁcally tailored for TIR human body imagery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms existing segmentation methods on the HBTIR dataset.},

  abstract    = {Thermal metamaterial represents a groundbreaking approach to control heat conduction, and, as a crucial component, thermal invisibility is of utmost importance for heat management. Despite the flourishing development of thermal invisibility schemes, they still face two limitations in practical applications. First, objects are typically completely enclosed in traditional cloaks, making them difficult to use and unsuitable for objects with heat sources. Second, although some theoretical proposals have been put forth to change the thermal conductivity of materials to achieve dynamic invisibility, their designs are complex and rigid, making them unsuitable for large-scale use in real three-dimensional (3D) spaces. Here, we propose a concept of a thermal dome to achieve 3D invisibility. Our scheme includes an open functional area, greatly enhancing its usability and applicability. It features a reconfigurable structure, constructed with simple isotropic natural materials, making it suitable for dynamic requirements. The performance of our reconfigurable thermal dome has been confirmed through simulations and experiments, consistent with the theory. The introduction of this concept can greatly advance the development of thermal invisibility technology from theory to engineering and provide inspiration for other physical domains, such as direct current electric fields and magnetic fields.},

  abstract    = {Recent investigations on non-Hermitian physics have unlocked new possibilities to manipulate wave scattering on lossy materials. Coherent perfect absorption is such an effect that enables all-light control by incorporating a suitable amount of loss. On the other hand, controlling heat transfer with heat may empower a distinct paradigm other than using thermal metamaterials. However, since heat neither propagates nor carries any momentum, almost all concepts in wave scattering are ill-defined for steady-state heat diffusion, making it formidable to understand or utilize any coherent effect. Here, we establish a scattering theory for heat diffusion by introducing an imitated momentum for thermal fields. The thermal analogue of coherent perfect absorption is thus predicted and demonstrated as the perfect absorption of exergy fluxes and undisturbed temperature fields. Unlike its photonic counterpart, thermal coherent perfect absorption can be realized for regular thermal materials, and be generalized for various objects.},

Furthermore, as a demonstration, a photonic-firework-like color filter array is achieved in a single step via thermal engineering. Based on this one-step-forming color array, a computational spectrometer is also realized featuring a resolvability of 10 nm and operating bandwidth covering the whole visible range. Considering its compactness and mass production capability, this method has numerous potential applications in, e.g., imaging, anti-counterfeiting, printing, color display, and spectroscopy.},

  abstract    = {Convective thermal metamaterials are artificial structures where convection dominates in the thermal process. Due to the field coupling between velocity and temperature, convection provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, thus allowing active and robust thermal modulations. With the introduced convective effects, the original parabolic Fourier heat equation for pure conduction can be transformed to hyperbolic. Therefore, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave-like fashion, reviving many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion. Here, recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials are reviewed and the state-of-the-art discoveries are classified into the following four aspects, enhancing heat transfer, porous-media-based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non-Hermitian phenomena. Finally, a prospect is cast on convective thermal metamaterials from two aspects. One is to utilize the convective parameter space to explore topological thermal effects. The other is to further broaden the convective parameter space with spatiotemporal modulation and multi-physical effects.},

  abstract   = {The Hamiltonian interprets how the system evolves, while the scattering coefficients describe how the system responds to inputs. Recent studies on non-Hermitian physics have revealed many unconventional effects. However, in all cases, the non-Hermiticity such as material loss is only considered for the Hamiltonian, even when studying scattering properties. Another important component-the scattering channel, is always assumed to be lossless and time-reversal symmetric. This assumption hinders the exploration on the more general and fundamental properties of non-Hermitian scattering. Here, we identify a novel kind of scattering channel that obeys time-reversal anti-symmetry. Such diffusive scattering channels overturn the conventional understanding about scattering symmetry by linking the positive and negative frequencies. By probing non-Hermitian systems with the diffusive channels, we reveal a hidden anti-parity-time (APT) scattering symmetry, which is distinct from the APT symmetry of Hamiltonians studied before. The symmetric and symmetry broken scattering phases are observed for the first time as the collapse and revival of temperature oscillation. Our work highlights the overlooked role of scattering channels in the symmetry and phase transition of non-Hermitian systems, thereby gives the diffusion the new life as a signal carrier. Our findings can be utilized to the analysis and control of strongly dissipative phenomena such as heat transfer and charge diffusion.},

Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, the creation of a convection‐based thermal metadevice which supports both dynamic and steady‐state nonreciprocal heat circulation is reported. The nontrivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters is observed and the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering is revealed at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi‐symmetric scattering matrix of the three‐port metadevice and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. The findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady‐state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat‐transfer‐related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.},
