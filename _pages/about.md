### Short Bio

I'm pursuing Ph.D. in Electronic Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Ying Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yingli) and [Prof. Hongsheng Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenhongsheng). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Physics from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn), Zhejiang University, in 2021, with a minor in Finance.

My research insterests involve open quantum systems, quantum information and heat modulation. Sepcifically, I focus on the time-modulated systems coupled to external environments，exploring optimization problems related to specific quantities during system evolution. The scope of my work ranges from classical systems (such as heat transfer and waveguide systems) to quantum regimes (like trapped ions). Currently, I am conducting research at NUS on quantum heat engines and quantum machine learning under the supervision of [Prof. Jiangbin Gong](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/faculty/gong-jiangbin/).
