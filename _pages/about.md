Welcom!
I'm pursuing Ph.D. in Electronic Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Ying Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yingli) and [Prof. Hongsheng Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenhongsheng). I obtained my Physics Bachelor's Degree from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn), Zhejiang University, in 2021. In my undergradute, I also minjored Finance.

My research insterests involve open quantum systems, quantum information and heat modulation, and. Sepcifically, I pay more attention to the time-modulated systems which coulped to the external enviromentï¼Œinvestigating the optimization problems associcated with a given quantity during evolution. The systems I studied range from classical (e.g., heat tranfer systems and waveguide systems) to quantum region (trapped ions). Currently, I fly to NUS to conduct researchs on quantum heat engine and quantum machine learning.
